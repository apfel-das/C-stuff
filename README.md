# C stuff
## A small archive of scripts written in C, scripts solve simple problems on topics as:
  
    - Linkes Lists manipulation
    - Pointers 
    - Type Casting 
    - Memory Management in C
    
    Most (but not all ) were written for academic purposes  (Technincal university of Crete, MHL Lab)
    
    Scripts explained above:
                                                                                      
                                                                                        
 1. SimpleLinkedList.c
 	- Create an Empty List
 	- Insert a node at the end of the list
 	- Delete an Element (based on some value inside a node)
 	- Print all Elements (hierarhycally)
 	- Print Info concerning size of elements, base address etc.

 2. someScript.c
 	- Creates a printable  triangle via an Array (formating output %4d and nested loops)
 	- Checks if a numer is odd or even (via a mask with 1)
 	- Transfers elements from A to B where A,B are arrays
 
 
 
 3. substringFinder.c
- Locates any given substring from a string (both Intrepreted as Arrays)
   - Code was wrote down in paper as a final exam topic
   - Uploaded in MIPS Assembly as well (actual goal of the exam was that)
   
 4. pairFinder.c
    - Solution for a Google Interview problem.
    - Goal is to find any pair (in a given structure of known size) with has a predefined sum.
    - [1,3,4,4] -> 8 (OK)
    - [1,3,4,9] -> 8 (NOT OK)
